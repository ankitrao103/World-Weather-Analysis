# World_Weather_Analysis_Challenge

## Overview 

This project has been undertaken on behalf of PlanMyTrip, a travel technology company that specializes in Internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. We have used Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,CitiPy along with APIs like OpenWeathermap and GoogleMap to create an app where customers can identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels based on their weather preference.
